This data science application is dedicated to let users have a better understanding of the salary range in the data science domain.The data includes information on a variety of elements that may have an impact on salary, including job title, years of experience, company location, company size and so on. We can better understand how these factors affect salaries in various areas and businesses by evaluating this data. Job searchers can use this information to assess available opportunities, bargain salaries, and make well-informed decisions about their future routes. Companies can make improvements to their compensation packages to better entice and keep top personnel by using this data to evaluate how competitive they are.
The widgets and panels I created are designed to provide users the option of selecting the information they wish to view or exclude in order to better serve their individual needs. For instance, in the first group of data, by clicking on the selected year and selected variable buttons, we may select the particular aspect of the salary range that we want to pay attention to. Also, there is a pay ranger that enables us to change the salary range to achieve the desired outcomes.
